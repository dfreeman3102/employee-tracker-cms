# employee-tracker-cms
Tenth bootcamp challenge using what we have learned in class, with help from instructors, classmates, 
and outside research(YouTube tutorials, stack overflow, etc.) to make a CMS for employee tracking.
When opened, you are presented with options. Once clicked they will either present you with a formatted
table to view, or you are presented with questions you must answer. After filling out your answers,
you are presented with the updated table of information.
